# Keybindings

This is the source-of-truth catalog of every keyboard shortcut the TUI recognizes. Bindings are grouped by **context** — the focus or modal state they fire in. A binding listed under "Composer" only takes effect when the composer is focused; one under "Transcript" only when the transcript has focus; and so on.

Bindings are not (yet) user-configurable — tracked for a future release (#436, #437). This document is the contract that future config-file overrides will name into.

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Enter`                     | Send the message (or run the slash command)             |

| `Ctrl-E` / `End`            | Move to end of line                                     |

| `Ctrl-V` / `Cmd-V`          | Paste from clipboard (also bracketed-paste auto-handled)|
| `Ctrl-Y`                    | Yank (paste) from kill buffer                           |
| `↑` / `↓`                   | Cycle composer history (also selects popup/attachment items) |

### `@` mentions

Type `@<partial>` to open the file mention popup. `↑`/`↓` cycle the entries, `Tab` or `Enter` accepts. `Esc` hides the popup. As of v0.8.10 (#441), completions are re-ranked by mention frecency — files you mention often + recently float to the top.

### `#` quick-add (memory)

When `[memory] enabled = true`, typing `# foo` and pressing `Enter` appends `foo` as a timestamped bullet to your memory file *without* sending a turn. See `docs/MEMORY.md`.

## v0.8.13 audit notes

- **Ctrl-S is stash, not history search.** Fixed in this revision — `Alt-R` is history search.
- **Phantom `Alt+Up` removed.** The "Edit last queued message" binding was listed in README but never existed in the key dispatch code.
- **Bare Up/Down arrows scroll transcript when composer empty (v0.8.13).** Previously the `should_scroll_with_arrows` gate was hardcoded to false, meaning bare arrows always navigated composer history even when the composer was empty. Users in virtual terminals (Ghostty, Codex, Kitty-protocol) were especially affected because they couldn't use Cmd+Up / Alt+Up shortcuts.
- **Configurable keymap (#436) and `tui.toml` (#437) remain deferred.** The `TuiPrefs` struct and loader exist in `settings.rs` but are not wired at startup. The named-binding registry that would let `~/.deepseek/tui.toml` override individual entries is still pending.
- **No other broken bindings found.** Every other chord listed above resolves to a live handler in `crates/tui/src/tui/ui.rs` (key-event dispatch) or `crates/tui/src/tui/app.rs` (mode + state transitions).
